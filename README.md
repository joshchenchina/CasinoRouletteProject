Introduction:
Casinos are notorious for giving refuge to those who wish to take the opportunity to increase their wealth. One game in particular, Roulette, provides the player with multiple choices to make their fortunes. In Roulette, the main component is a wheel divided into equally sized slots, where each slot can be a numerical value and a color. The wheel is spun and a ball is placed in, and eventually seats into a slot. The player has multiple options to bet on, including:
The outcome is red/black
The outcome is an odd/even number
The outcome is within a range of values
The outcome is a numerical value
The outcome is within a column of the table (3,6,9,12,15,...36)

Therefore, this project has 4 functions:
1. Custom: Input number of trials, students and allowance; Select Wheel and Odds.
2. Add Green Space: Input number of trials, students and allowance; Choose number of extra green space other than the original wheel. Then, choose the size of the additional green space(probability the new space will be selected in each round of game).
3. Carve Wheels: Input number of trials, students and allowance; Change Size of each space on the wheel(probability each space will be selected in each round of game).
4. Modify Odds: Input number of trials, student and allowance; Modify the odds for each options(The money casino will pay to the gamblers if they win, according to which kind of bet they made).

For this project, we use Java for implementing the simulation. We also implement Graphic User Interfaces for customer using this software conveniently.
